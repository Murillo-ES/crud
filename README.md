# e-Commerce Project (Work in Progress)

This is a simple **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application** built using **PHP** and **Laravel**. It is a work in progress and serves as a learning project as I improve my skills as a beginner developer.

## Features

âœ… **Product Management** (Add, Edit, Delete, List)  
âœ… **Livewire Integration** for dynamic UI updates  
âœ… **Sorting & Filtering** for products  
âœ… **Shopping Cart** with item quantity control  
âœ… **Database Relationships** (One-to-Many between Users and Products)  
âœ… **Custom Blade Components** for reusability

## Future Features

This are features that I intend on implementing on this application in the near future.

ðŸ“Œ **API Features** -> Although the initial API was already set, many other features were implemented since the initial coding, rendering it obsolete. I intend to address those issues initially.

ðŸ“Œ **List of Users to PDF/CSV** -> The products list already has that feature implemented. A similar one will be added to the Users' list.

ðŸ“Œ **New Home Screen** -> Currently, the "Home" button redirects the user to the Products list. A separate Home route will be added.

ðŸ“Œ On top of those changes, I intend to **review** and **refactor** the code constantly, as to improve its longevity and readability.
